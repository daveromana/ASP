        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br />

    <h2>Will the canvas get damaged easily?</h2>
    <p>We coat your canvas with a special varnish for extra protection against liquids, dirt, and fading.</p><br\ />
    
    <h2>Can I hang my canvas in a sunny room?</h2>
    <p>Yes, the print varnish that we use has strong UV protection. Although we always say, the more careful you can be with            your canvas, the longer it will ultimately last.</p><br />

    <h2>I spilled water on my canvas, is that OK?</h2>
    <p>Your canvas is produced with a lot of added protection. Although it isn’t waterproof and may be damaged by water or              other liquids, it will resist splashes quite well.</p><br />

    <h2>How long does it take for the canvas to be shipped?</h2>
    <p>Delivery times vary based on a few factors but we generally say that prints will ship out in 10 to 15 business                   days.</p><br />

    <h2>What if my canvas is damaged upon delivery?</h2>
    <p>Don’t worry, we will replace it with a brand new one free of charge. Just email us so we can send you instructions.</p><br />

    <h2>Is professional Wrestling Fixed?</h2>
        <p>A little off topic, but yes... Yes it is.</p><br />
